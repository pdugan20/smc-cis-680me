            	<h2>Overview <span>of Services</span></h2>
U.S. immigration law is complex and nuanced, and changes frequently. The requirements for navigating an application for asylum, residence or citizenship can be confusing. Whether you have lived here for many years and want to legalize your status, or have recently arrived and need assistance in applying for asylum or residence, we can assist you. The Law Office of Marie B. Higuera, Immigration Attorneys, works with clients to help them with their immigration matters.
<p>To schedule your initial consultation, please contact an attorney or call 206-267-0233 or toll free 1-866-591-6454
<p><b>Asylum practice:</b> If you are living in fear of persecution or harm in your home country, you may qualify for asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against Torture relief.
<p><b>Violence Against Women Act relief:</b> This law intends to protect vulnerable people from violence. Working with a lawyer can help protect your rights and obtain legal immigration status.
<p><b>Waivers:</b> Do you have a criminal history, unlawful presence or other issues that make it difficult to obtain legal residence? Obtaining a waiver of inadmissibility or a waiver of prior removal or deportation may make residency possible.
<p><b>Family based adjustment of status:</b> We can assist with adjustments of status based on family relationships to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.
<p><b>Deportation Defense:</b> We provide representation in all phases of removal and deportation proceedings.
<p><b>Family Immigration:</b> We reunite families and keep them together by helping them with safe and legal U.S. visa and residence applications.
<p><b>Consular Processing:</b> We provide immigration assistance to family members outside the country.

<p>If you are facing legal issues that are making it difficult to obtain residence or citizenship in the United States, working with an attorney can help. To schedule an appointment, please contact the firm or call 206-267-0233
