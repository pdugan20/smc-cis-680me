SET AnalystNote="As I discussed with lgomez, the merchant who wrote in was already aware of the URL in question. A buyer had contacted him regarding another merchant selling iphones under this mans business name. Attached to the trax email was a pdf containing the SKU of an iphone, the order-id, and the name of the business this man was questioning.  The buyer had contacted this man explaining somebody else was using his business name, and he in turn contacted us. I think its ridiculous that I'm being escalated for assisting a merchant that I already escalated another analyst for, for failing to correctly answer the mans question the first time. He clearly was aware of the URL I included in the email. In fact, that was the entire reason he contacted us to begin with."

UPDATE mRiskQualityDashboardFeedback 
SET AnalystNote="disagree completely with feedback. at time of review, merchant only had 1 negative rating out of 8 positive reviews: http://www.ecrater.com/view-feedback.php?storeid=202531. merchant had been operating since 02/2011 with good history, and reviews like Hassle free, qick transaction. Items exactly as pictured. accurint was a match to Guo Liu at biz address provided, and shows a completely clean credit history with no bankruptcies, leans, or chargebacks. even if the merchant had in fact been found to have a bad credit history, which he did not, the overwhelming number of good reviews on his account should have been enough to keep him open since we do not normally close for bad credit alone. in summation, I believe this escalation holds absolutely no merit or substantial evidence to prove that my initial release was incorrect."
